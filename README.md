#DataScience

This is an interdisciplinary field, and the foundations of data science include statistics, inference, 
computer science, predictive analytics, machine learning algorithm development, and new technologies to gain insights from big data.

#Python Libraries for Data Science

1. Numpy : NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
2. Pandas : Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. I
3. Matplotlib : Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.
4. Seaborn : Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures in Python. Visualization is the central part of Seaborn which helps in exploration and understanding of data. One has to be familiar with Numpy and Matplotlib and Pandas to learn about Seaborn.
5. Sci-Kit Learn : Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines.
